# EarlyDetectionHBOC

## Overview
This repository contains the complete data-processing pipeline used to generate all figures, analyses, and results for the manuscript *Early Cancer Detection in Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome with Cell-Free DNA*.  
The pipeline runs end-to-end automatically: it prepares directories, checks and installs required packages, executes all analysis modules, and produces processed data tables, publication-ready figures, and HTML reports.

## Data
Please see the *Data and Code Availability* section in the Manuscript for the Zenodo link and download the `raw_data` input from Zenodo.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Requirements
- R: https://www.r-project.org  
- RStudio (optional): https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

### 2. Download or Clone This Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pughlab/EarlyDetectionHBOC.git
cd EarlyDetectionHBOC
```


### 3. Download Raw Data
Download `raw_data.zip` from Zenodo (*see link in Code and Data Availability*), unzip it, and place the resulting `raw_data/` directory in the project root.

### 4. Install Required R Packages
```bash
Rscript Install_Packages.R
```

This script verifies and installs all necessary R package dependencies.

### 4. Run the Full Pipeline
```bash
Rscript run_all_scripts.R
```

During execution, the pipeline will automatically:  
- generate processed datasets (`data/`)  
- produce publication-ready figures (`figures/`)  
- write rendered reports (`HTML/`)
